## My Projects

### [AI-Driven ML Pipeline for Continuous Training and Subjective Grading](https://github.com/kalyani-Goda/Bodhitree_AI_Server)
An AI-powered automated grading system integrated within the Bodhitree e-learning platform of IIT Bombay.

- Designed and deployed an AI assistant for source code grading using fine-tuned CodeLlama-7B.

- Reduced TA workload by 25% through AI-suggested grades and automated grading pipelines.

- Technology Used: Python, Django, Rest API, Hugging Face, PyTorch, MLflow.

### [Comparative Study of LLMs for Subjective Grading](https://github.com/kalyani-Goda/AI4Code-Assesment)
An open-source LLM-based system for automated assessment of programming assignments. I studied different decoder LLMs and encoder LLMs for this code assessment task.

- Developed an open-source LLM-based grading model using DPO and prompt engineering techniques.

- Curated a dataset of 3700+ code submissions with well-defined rubrics and achieved 82% grading accuracy.

- Technology Used: Huggingface, PyTorch, LLMs, Transformers.

### [Image Caption Consistency Checker](https://github.com/kalyani-Goda/Image_Captioning/tree/main/Image_captioning)

A deep learning system to evaluate the semantic alignment between images and their captions.

- Achieved 68% accuracy in image-caption verification using ResNet and CLIP-ViT for feature extraction.

- Designed a feed-forward neural network for multimodal embedding alignment, reducing false positives by 35% and achieving an F1 score of 0.72.

### [Fine-grained Named Entity Recognition System](https://github.com/kalyani-Goda/FIGER-NER)

A deep learning-based NER system for identifying and classifying 112 fine-grained entity types.

- Enhanced data extraction accuracy by 97% by implementing a NER tagger with Bidirectional LSTM and BERT.

- Achieved 0.98 Loose Macro F1 score using fine-tuned DistilBERT.

### [Document-Augmented QA System](https://github.com/kalyani-Goda/Question-Answering-using-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation)

A question-answering system for efficient information retrieval from large documents.

- Developed RAG-based QA system using Vector Store Index with F1 score 92%.

- Implemented T5-Large and MiniLM models for text embeddings.
